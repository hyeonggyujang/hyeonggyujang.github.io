        Hello visitor, my name is Hyeong Gyu Jang, a current student of Grand Valley State University
        Applied Computer Science Master's program. Having graduated Calvin University with Biochemistry
        and Data Science majors, I am gaining more experience in computer science in order to join
        the global trend of booming technology industry. The fields of interest includes: biomedical
        research, IoT development, and data engineering.
        <br>
        <br>
        Apart from my academic life, I enjoy reading and sipping good beverages. A cozy evening where I have
        a good read and a good cup of beverage either tea or beer, that's my ideal rest. For reading, I recently
        got introduced to science fiction by my coworkers, and the books are keeping me awake at nights.
        I normally read non-fictions, mainly on natural sciences, economy, and philosophy, but I usually
        don't talk about these topics because I don't want to sound pretentious. On beverages, I love
        brewing and drinking coffee, as I'm known as a coffee-geek among my friends. Also, taking an
        advantage of my current location, Grand Rapids the beer city, I started enjoying local beers.
        As you can see, I'm not so physical about my hobbies, but I'd play tennis, volleyball, or soccer
        from time to time when I feel dorment.

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>&emsp; &emsp; Being away from home, in the land of strangers, a young college student can become isoloated
         from access to basic ammenities. As being international students ourselves, the team members
          were deeply resonated with the need of a medium used for asking for a ride. Therefore, to 
          satisfy such business needs, our team would like to develop a ride-sharing platform. 
          With our application, any student can more easily have access to a grocery shop, to 
          entertainments, and to the outside society.
        </p>
        <p> &emsp; &emsp;Our team is building a cross-platform mobile application for a university, where all students 
          and faculty members can join and share rides. Any member of our application can ask for a ride 
          by simply posting a plan, and whichever member who has a vehicle can pick up the member who 
          asked for a ride. Alternatively, any member who already owns a vehicle can post his/her plan to 
          visit somewhere, and whoever fits the schdule can join the trip in first-come-first-serve basis. 
          Ideally, our application can provide both convenience and safety in sharing rides within a 
          friendly community where the security is better than it is in other commercial ride-sharing 
          applications in the market.
